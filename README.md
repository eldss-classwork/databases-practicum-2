# databases-practicum-2
Files for practicum 2 in the databases course at Northeastern.

## Getting Started

We've decided to work with SQLite for this practicum. As such, to work with these files you will need SQLite installed on your machine. The data we are using is provided by IMDB at https://datasets.imdbws.com/ 

Download all the compresed tsv files and extract them into a folder called `data/`. The extracted files will all be called `data.tsv` so you will have to rename each. Rename them based on the compressed file name as follows in order to ensure they work with the R-notebook:

<first_part>-<second_part>-data.tsv

for example, name-basics-tsv and title-ratings-data.tsv
