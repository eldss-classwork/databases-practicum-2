# databases-practicum-2
Files for practicum 2 in the databases course at Northeastern.

## Getting Started

We've decided to work with SQLite for this practicum. As such, to work with these files you will need SQLite installed on your machine. The data we are using is provided by IMDB at https://datasets.imdbws.com/

Download all the compressed tsv files into a folder called `data/`. You can leave them in their compressed format, as that is how we will read them in to the R notebook.
